# AutoLayerMasks
Adobe Photoshop Script for auto creating layers out of masks

This is a free JavaScript for Adobe Photoshop. It allows user to generate for a layer automatically masks out of a group of layers.<br/>
Basic usage: <br/>
1) Create in PS a group with mask layers (basically black&white or grayscale images representing masks). <br/>
2) Select the RGB Layer (the beauty shot)<br/>
Run the AutoLayerMasks Script.<br/>

It will create RGB (Beauty Shot) images masked with masks from the group. <br/>
If there are 20 predefined masks in the group, 20 RBG masked BeautyShots will be automatically created.<br/>

This script works at best in combination with Crytpmatte render passes from 3D Software. <br/>
They can be imported in Photoshop using Exr-IO importer.<br/>
You can get the free Exr-IO Importer from<br/>
